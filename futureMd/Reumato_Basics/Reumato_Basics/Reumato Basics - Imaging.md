**Arthritis** gold standard imaging exam is {{c:MRI}}

**Arthritis** 1st line imaging exam is generally {{c:Eco-doppler}}
-  MRI if still in doubt afterwars
  
**Arthritis** where first imaging exam is {{c:**X-ray**}} is {{c:**sacroiliitis**}}
  
**Vertebral column** imaging is 1st line {{c:X-ray}} if **bone disease**
  
**Vertebral column** imaging is 1st line {{c:CT/MRI}} if soft tissue abnormality, infection or in the presence of neurological deficits
-  CT should be ordered as a second-line test if MRI is contraindicated or if MRI is not available. The sensitivity of CT for spondylodiscitis or soft tissue involvement (e.g., paravertebral abscess) is lower than MRI, so MRI is the more appropriate test
