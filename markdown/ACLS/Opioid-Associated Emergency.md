### Algorithm for Healthcare Providers

- In suspected opioid poisoning if person is breathing normally, next step is {{c:prevent deterioration}}
- In suspected opioid poisoning if person is not breathing normally and has a pulse, next step is {{c:give naloxone}} + {{c:support ventilation}}
- In suspected opioid poisoning if person is not breathing normally and has no pulse, next step is {{c:start CPR}}

### Algorithm for Lay Responders

- In suspected opioid poisoning as a lay responder if person is not breathing normally {{c:start CPR + give naloxone + use an AED}}

For adult and adolescent victims, responders should perform compressions and rescue breaths for opioid-associated emergencies if they are trained and perform Hands-Only CPR if not trained to perform rescue breaths. For infants and children, CPR should include compressions with rescue breaths.

### Prevent Deterioration

- Tap and shout
- Open the airway and reposition
- Consider naloxone
- Transport to the hospital

### Support ventilation

- Open the airway and reposition
- Provide rescue breathing or a bag-mask device

### Start CPR

- Use an AED
- Consider naloxone
- Refer to the BLS/Cardiac
- Arrest algorithm
