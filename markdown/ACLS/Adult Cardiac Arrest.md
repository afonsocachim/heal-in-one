### Overview

- Patient without pulse, first step is {{c:start CPR}}
- Patient without pulse, after PCR started give {{c:oxygen}} and attach {{c:monitor/defibrillator}}
- Patient without pulse, shockable rhythms are {{c:VF/pVT}}
- Patient without pulse, unshockable rhythms are {{c:Assystole/PEA}}

### Quality CPR

- While doing CPR push at least {{c:5}} cm and at {{c:100}} bpm
  - And allow complete chest recoil
- While doing CPR change compressor every {{c:2}} minutes
- While doing CPR if no advanced airway do {{c:30}} compressions followed by {{c:2}} ventilations
  - 30:2 ratio, avoid excessive ventilation

#### VF/pVT algorithm

- Patient in VF/pVT next step is {{c:shock}} + {{c:CPR 2 min}} + {{c:IV access}} and reassess rhythm
- Patient in VF/pVT after shock + CPR 2 min, next step is {{c:shock}} + {{c:CPR 2 min}} + {{c:Epinephrine every 4 min}} and reasess rhythm
- Patient in VF/pVT after shock + CPR 2 min, consider {{c:advanced airway capnography}}
- Patient in VF/pVT after shock + CPR 2 min + Epinephrine, next step is {{c:shock}} + {{c:CPR 2 min}} + {{c:Amiodorone}} and reasess rhythm
  - Amiodorone or lidocaine

### Assystole/PEA

- Patient in Assystole/PEA next step is {{c:CPR 2 min}} + {{c:IV access}} + {{c:Epinephrine every 4 min}} and reassess rhythm
- Patient in Assystole/PEA after CPR 2 min + Epinephrine, next step is {{c:CPR 2 min}} + {{c:treat reversible causes}} and and reassess rhythm

#### Reversible Causes of Assystole/PEA

- Reversible causes of Assystole/PEA mnemonic is "{{c:5 H’s and 5 T’s}}"
- Reversible causes of Assystole/PEA 5 Hs are {{c:Hypoxemia}}, {{c:Hypovolemia}}, {{c:Hypothermia}}, {{c:Hydrogen ion acidosis}} and {{c:Hypo/hyperkalemia}}
- Reversible causes of Assystole/PEA 5 Ts are {{c:Trauma}}, {{c:Toxins}}, {{c:Thrombosis}}, {{c:Tamponade}} and {{c:Tension pneumothorax}},

### Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)

- In adult cardiac arrest ROSC is typically seen through {{c:pulse}} or blood pressure
- In adult cardiac arrest ROSC can be seen with an abrupt increase in PETCO2 typically {{c:> 40}} mmHg
- In adult cardiac arrest ROSC can be seen with spontaneous arteriral pressure waves with intra-arterial monitoring

### Drug Therapy

- In adult cardiac arrest IV/IO dose of epinephrine is {{c:1 mg}} every {{c:4}} minutes
- In adult cardiac arrest IV/IO dose of amiodorone is 1st dose {{c:300 mg}} bolus 2nd dose {{c:150 mg}}
- In adult cardiac arrest IV/IO dose of lidocaine is 1st dose {{c:1 mg/kg}} bolus 2nd dose {{c:0.5 mg/kg}}

### Shock Energy In Defibrillation

- In adult cardiac arrest shock energy for defibrillation if monophasic is {{c:360}} J
- In adult cardiac arrest shock energy for defibrillation if biphasic is manufacter recommendation or {{c:maximum available}}
  - Second and subsequent doses should be equivalente and higher doses may be considered

### Advanced Airway

- In adult cardiac arrest advanced airway is done with {{c:endotracheal intubation}} or supraglottic advanced airway
- In adult cardiac arrest to monitor ET tube placement use {{c:capnography}}
  - Waveform capnography or capnometry
- In adult cardiac arrest once advanced airway is in place give 1 breath every {{c:6 seconds}}
  - 10 breaths/min with continuous chest compressions

VF - ventricullar fibrillation pVT is Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia
PEA - pulseless electrical activity
PETCO2 - pressure of end‑tidal CO2
