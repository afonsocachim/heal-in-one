### Intial Stabilization Phase

- After ROSC , next step is {{c:place endotracheal tube}}
- After ROSC and endotracheal tube placement start {{c:10}} breaths/min
- After ROSC keep SpO2 between {{c:92-98}}% and PACO2 between {{c:35-45}} mmHg
- After ROSC keep Systolic BP {{c:>90}} mmHg and MAP between {{c:65}} mmHg
- After ROSC and patient stable obtain {{c:12-lead ECG}}

### Continued Management Phase

- After ROSC and patient stable consider emergent cardiac intervention if {{c:STEMI}} present or unstable cardiogenic shock
  - Also if mechanical circulatory support required
- After ROSC and patient stable, next step is {{c:check if pt follows commands}}
- After ROSC and patient stable and follow commands, next step is {{c:other critical care management}}
- After ROSC and patient stable and does not follow commands, next step is {{c:TTM}}, {{c:Brain-CT}}, {{c:EEG}}

### TTM

- After ROSC evaluations should be done concurrently so that decisions on TTM receive {{c:high}} priority as cardiac interventions
- After ROSC start TTM asap; begin at {{c:32-36}}Â°C for 24 hours by using a {{c:cooling}} device with feedback loop
